# An Express backend jump starter

Working with full stack javascript is a bliss. Simply becuase you are not always context switching with a different language. 
However, most often it comes with lots of boilerplate code. This is just my personal way of jump starting one.


## Features
Here is a list of what it includes:

1. Typescript for types
2. Nodemon, Concurrently, Morgan
3. Express as the main framework
4. PostgreSQL for the dataase
